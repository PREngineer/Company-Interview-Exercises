How can I achieve this using PHP, Azure, and Azure Kubernetes Service:

Create a very simple REST API that, when its endpoint is called, returns one object from Azure Blob Storage that is a JSON file. For example GET /api/foo returns contents of JSON file with something like { "greeting": "I am the Foo" }.  Keep this simple, it's a 10-20 line app at most.

Requirements:
1. Use infrastructure as code
2. Use containers for the application backend
3. Deploy the backend to a private network (VPC or VNet)
4. Create your own Azure Blob Storage for the JSON files
5. Expose the service through a termination on publicly accessible network (meaning that the application should be accessible using a common web browser and the URL that was generated by the deployment process)
6. Make the service autoscale

Given that the application has to be so small.  It is best to not try to protect the contents of the blob as that would require me to include a bunch of code from Microsoft PHP classes to access the blobs.  https://github.com/uglide/azure-content/blob/master/articles/storage/storage-php-how-to-use-blobs.md
